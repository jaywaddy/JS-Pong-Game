# JavaScript Pong Game

> Pong Game - two paddles knocking a puck back and forth, scoring a point if the player kocks the puck past the other paddle. I would like to include power ups, stat changes: `speed`, `controll`, `catching` and `throwing`, etc. The goal is to take a simple game and turn it into something more advanced but FUN.
